# bamazon
Bamazon is like an Amazon-like storefront CLI created using JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL.
The file bamazonCustomer.js, when executed will ask the customer if they will want to buy an item. If choose [No], will exit out of the app. If chooses [Yes], the users chooses an item from the ID list. If the item have zero left in the stock inventory, it will display “Insufficient quantity!” and asked the customer to pick another item again. If the customer chooses an item and have enough in stock, the app will delete the amount the customer have input, display out the total sales price and update the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
